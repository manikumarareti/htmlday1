Zomato said they have ‘disabled delivery of non-veg items’ in certain states in accordance with government instructions.<br>
Zomato on Monday responded to a customer's complaint on X regarding the unavailability of chicken for food delivery, saying that they have ‘disabled delivery of non-veg items’ in certain states in accordance with government instructions.<br>

The user tagged the food-delivery app and humorously mentioned, “Zomato is not delivering chicken in bhopal today lmao”. Speculating about the reason, the user added, "“tbh it could be because of supply of meat not being available today v/s anything decision by zomato.”<br>
Zomato replied, clarifying,“Hi, we have disabled delivery of non-veg items in Uttar Pradesh, Assam, ⁠Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as per govt. notice. Hope this clarification helps!”<br>

This decision aligns with Uttar Pradesh's, along with a few other states', move to ban the sale of meat and fish on Monday, coinciding with the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.<br>
